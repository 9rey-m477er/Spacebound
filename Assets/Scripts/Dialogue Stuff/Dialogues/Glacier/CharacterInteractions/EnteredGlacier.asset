  - Brrr! Who turned off the heat?
  - Why is it so cold?
  - "It\u2019s the Glacier Biome. What did you expect?"
  - "I know it\u2019s supposed to be cold, but I wasn\u2019t expecting this."
  - How are you not cold?
  - "I\u2019m just not."
  - Do we have to explore this biome?
  - Yes. I detect an escape pod and a rocket piece nearby.
  - Ugh!!
  - Listen here, you two! Do you want to go home or not?
  - We do.
  - Then act like it!
  - "Now, come on. Let\u2019s not waste any more of my time."
  - Alright.
