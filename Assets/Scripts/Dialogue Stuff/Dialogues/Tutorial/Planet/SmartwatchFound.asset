  - Are you alright?
  - "I\u2019m fine. Are the others with you?"
  - "Haven\u2019t seen them."
  - "Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m able to ascertain their location. The escape pods
    have trackers in them."
  - Did you come from the escape pod by the rocket?
  - I did.
  - So, the remaining ones can be found in each biome.
  - Biome?
  - While searching, I also gathered intel about where we are.
  - This planet has three biomes, and we crashed right near a convenience store.
  - The others can be found in the Forest, Glacier, and Volcano biomes.
  - "So, this is not the planet we\u2019re supposed to be on?"
  - "No, this is a different planet. I don\u2019t have enough information, so you
    may have to investigate."
  - However, reuniting with the others solves one problem.
  - When the rocket crashed, a few pieces flew off into each of the biomes.
  - "Until we get those back, we won\u2019t be able to leave."
  - "Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get them back for you."
  - Thank you. Before you go, take anything you need from the rocket.
  - Take the smartwatch so we can communicate
  - Will do.
