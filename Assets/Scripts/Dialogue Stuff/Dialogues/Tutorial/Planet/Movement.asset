  paragraphs:
  - Just one more thing, Captain.
  - Yes?
  - Allow me to explain how to navigate throughout your adventure.
  - You already know that using the arrow keys is how you move.
  - To sprint, all you need to do is hold down the Shift key while moving.
  - Next, I will explain how to interact with anything or anyone on your adventure.
  - "An object is interactable whenever you are near it and see an \u201C!\u201D
    icon."
  - "Once you see the icon, press \u201CE\u201D to interact."
  - Be cautious of who or what you interact with.
  - You may find yourself in a predicament if you are not careful.
  - Finally, to open up the menu, press Escape.
  - From there, you can access your inventory and stats by pressing Tab to navigate
    to the requisite menus.
  - That covers everything you need to know about navigation and accessing the menu.
  - Thanks, T.H.E!
