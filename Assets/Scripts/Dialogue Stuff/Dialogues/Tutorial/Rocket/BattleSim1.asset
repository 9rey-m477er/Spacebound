  - "Alright, let\u2019s begin with a basic explanation of the battle."
  - The battles will have you engage in a front-line, back-line style fight.
  - Remember this. It is crucial to how you decide to line up in a fight.
  - "Front-liners\u2014you two, in this case\u2014have a high chance of landing an
    attack."
  - The caveat is that front-liners are more likely to get hit.
  - This is the inverse for back-liners.
  - Back-liners are less likely to get hit, but your accuracy in attacking is subpar.
  - "Next, let\u2019s move on to the three main attacks: Impact, Slice, and Puncture."
  - Too long. Bash. Slash. Poke.
  - Information updated. Thank you for your input.
  - Bash is a powerful strike on a single enemy.
  - The muscle-bound one said he would use his hands. That equates to the Bash move.
  - "Don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t just grab a hammer."
  - Slash is a sweeping attack across the front-line or back-line enemies.
  - The vertically challenged one would specialize in that attack.
  - Vertically challenged?!
  - Ha! Shortass.
  - Poke will attack one front-line and one back-line enemy in the same row.
  - The woman will specialize in that attack.
  - The woman. Okay.
