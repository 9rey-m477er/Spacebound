  paragraphs:
  - "Greetings, everyone! You must be the four embarking on today\u2019s mission."
  - Um, who are you?
  - "Oh, the workers didn\u2019t inform you? I am The Helpful Expeditionist, or T.H.E.
    for short."
  - "I\u2019m here to guide you on a mission to retrieve a golden artifact from Planet
    SF-BW."
  - This is a challenging mission, as the planet is home to some not-so-friendly
    monsters.
  - "Not to worry\u2014I have specialized training prepared for you all."
  - Please proceed to the large room at the back of the ship for a battle simulation
    training.
  - I will meet you there shortly.
