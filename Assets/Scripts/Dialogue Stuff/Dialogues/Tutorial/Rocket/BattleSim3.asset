  - Nice job, everyone. Let me explain the other things you can do when you fight.
  - "You have the option to defend, which consists of three actions: Block, Dodge,
    and Protect.\r"
  - Block allows you to take less damage if you are hit until your next turn.
  - Dodge gives you a greater chance of avoiding an attack until your next turn.
  - Protect allows you to bodyguard another party member until your next turn.
  - The person who is bodyguarding will suffer the full damage, so keep that in mind
    when choosing to protect someone.
  - The final option before I let you back into combat is Flee.
  - You can run away when you think a battle is too tough.
  - However, this may fail. If it does, you leave yourselves vulnerable to attacks.
  - For this fight, you will not be able to flee.
  - Sorry, there is one more thing.
  - If your HP is low, I will heal you.
  - Now, let the real training combat begin.
