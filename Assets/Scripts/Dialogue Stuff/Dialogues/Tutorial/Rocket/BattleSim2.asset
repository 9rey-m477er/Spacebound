  - "Next, you have three options for defend: Dodge, Block, and Protect.\r"
  - Dodge gives you a greater chance of avoiding an attack until your next turn.
  - Block allows you to take less damage if you are hit until your next turn.
  - Protect allows you to bodyguard another party member until your next turn.
  - The person who is bodyguarding will suffer great damage, so keep that in mind.
  - Next is the Inventory.
  - Any items you collect, you can use them in battle.
  - 'There are different kinds of items: healing, attacking, and defending. '
  - Of course, items are a limited resource so make sure you use them wisely!
  - The final option before I let you back into combat is Flee.
  - You can run away when you think a battle is too tough.
  - However, this may fail. If it does, you leave yourselves vulnerable to attacks.
  - For this fight, you will not be able to flee.
  - Sorry, there are two more things.
  - There is a battle log that will display what is going on throughout the fight.
  - It only displays the four most recent entries. But if you select the battle log
    --
  - You will be able to see up to twelve entries at a time.
  - Finally, if your HP is low, I will heal you.
  - Now, let the training combat begin!
