  - Welcome to the Simulation Room, where you will engage in comba training.
  - This will help you learn how to battle any enemies that stand in your way.
  - To begin, please use the monitor to select a weapon and put on the VR goggles.
  - "No weapon. I\u2019ll use my fists!"
  - "You think that\u2019s wise?"
  - Yes.
  - "Dumbass. I\u2019m going for the sword."
  - "I like that drill-looking spear. I\u2019m going for that."
  - (Which weapon should I go for?)
