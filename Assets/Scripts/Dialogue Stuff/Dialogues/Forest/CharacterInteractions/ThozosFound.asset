  - Is that an alien?
  - Appears so.
  - "I told Stevphen they\u2019re real."
  - Although this one looks different. Maybe it knows where the rocket piece is?
  - You speak alien?
  - They speak English.
  - "Excuse me, have you seen a rocket piece around? Our ship crashed, and we\u2019re
    trying to fix it."

  - "We didn\u2019t mean to. Our rocket malfunctioned and- Look, we just want to
    leave here and go home.\n"
