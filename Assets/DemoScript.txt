Where are we?
This is the rocket and we’re in space but it feels off.
STEVPHEN
Clearly, since when did it have these weird holograms? And since when did we have weapons?
Are we supposed to use it on those holograms?
JANET
Wasn’t something else supposed to happen though?
BOB
Unfortunately, it would appear that, given the DEFINITELY REASONABLE time frame for the mission, we were unable to gather enough resources to prepare a satisfactory introduction. 
JOHN, STEVPHEN, & JANET
Shut the $#%! up, Bob!!
JANET
They’re going to hear you. You’re not supposed to talk like that, Bob.
STEVPHEN
Leave it to the dumbass to spoil everything.
BOB
Oops.
JOHN
I’m gonna walk around. There’s nothing else to do besides that and using those holograms as practice dummies.
